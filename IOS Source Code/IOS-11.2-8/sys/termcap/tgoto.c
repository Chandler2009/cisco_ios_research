/*
 * Routine to perform cursor addressing.
 * CM is a string containing printf type escapes to allow
 * cursor addressing.  We start out ready to print the destination
 * line, and switch each time we print row or column.
 * The following escapes are defined for substituting row/column:
 *
 *	%d	as in printf
 *	%2	like %2d
 *	%3	like %3d
 *	%.	gives %c hacking special case characters
 *	%+x	like %c but adding x first
 *
 *	The codes below affect the state but don't use up a value.
 *
 *	%>xy	if value > x add y
 *	%r	reverses row/column
 *	%i	increments row/column (for one origin indexing)
 *	%%	gives %
 *	%B	BCD (2 decimal digits encoded in one byte)
 *	%D	Delta Data (backwards bcd)
 *
 * all other characters are ``self-inserting''.
